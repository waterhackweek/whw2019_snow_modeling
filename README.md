### The Problem:
* SUMMA (the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives) is a integrated snow hydrology model written in Fortran. As such, PySUMMA was developed as a python wrapper to the compiled Fortran code. This workgroup will explore a variety of fundamental yet important science questions relating to the snowpack energy balance.

### Data:

* CUES (CRREL/UCSB Energy Site) energy balance site, Mammoth Mountain, California [elev. 2940 m]

---

### Specific Questions/Goals:
* How are different model configurations sensitive to forcing data?
* Impact of layer thickness - Loop through different formulations of layer thicknesses and numbers.
* Derive albedo parameter distribution informed by Bayesian analysis of outputs.

### Broader Impacts and Applications:
* Multiple water years (i.e. different climatologies) will have different effects on model parameterizations.
* Different snow regimes will display varying sensitivities to changes in parameterizations.
